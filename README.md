## BOARDS
Whatever the project or process, 
boards keep tasks organized and 
work moving forward.In a glance 
you can see everything from 
“things to do” to “aww yeah we did it!”

## LISTS
The different stages of a task. Start as simple as To Do, Doing, or Done—or build a workflow custom fit to your team’s needs. There’s no wrong way to Trello.

## CARDS
Cards represent tasks and can hold all the information you need to get the job done. As you make progress, move cards across lists to show their status.

## Manage tasks with ease
Cards keep all of the information your team needs organized and in one place. Assign members, add due dates, leave comments, and more.

## Members
Keep everyone accountable and never have to ask “who’s doing that” by adding members to cards for their projects and tasks.

## Due dates
Doing and due dates go hand in hand. They're easy to set, hard to miss (with reminders!), and oh-so-satisfying to mark as “done.”
